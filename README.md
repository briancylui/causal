Robustness on causal discovery methods based on graphical models

## Data
Three self-processed real-world data sets are included in the `data/` directory ready for experiments, including:
1. U.S. Census data
2. Protein data in human cells
3. Drug resistance data from mice

## Experiments
R code for experiments are included in `stats361_proj.md`, which uses:
1. the `pcalg` package for the PC, GES, and LINGAM causal discovery algorithms
2. the `Rgraphviz` package for visualization of graphs output by the algorithms
